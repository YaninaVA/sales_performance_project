# E-Commerce Sales Performance & Customer Segmentation

## 📊 Project Overview

This project analyzes sales transactions from an online retail dataset to uncover patterns in customer behavior, product performance, and sales trends. The goal is to provide actionable insights that help increase profitability through better marketing and inventory strategies.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand customer purchasing behavior
- Segment customers using RFM and clustering techniques
- Identify top-selling and most-returned products
- Analyze sales trends over time
- Create dashboards for business decision-makers

## 🛠 Tools Used

- **SQL** – Filtering and cleaning transaction data
- **Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn)** – Analysis, customer segmentation
- **Tableau** – Interactive dashboards and KPI visualizations

## 🧾 Dataset

- [UCI Online Retail Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+Retail)  
  Includes over 500,000 transactions from a UK-based online retailer

*Alternative dataset*: [E-Commerce Data on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)

## 🔍 Key Analyses

- **Customer Segmentation**: RFM analysis and K-means clustering
- **Sales Trends**: Revenue and order volume by month, weekday, and hour
- **Returns Analysis**: Identify products with high return rates
- **Marketing Recommendations**: Personalized strategies by customer type

## 📈 Sample Insights

- Top 10% of customers generate over 60% of revenue
- Most returns happen on Mondays—often for expensive, fragile products
- Highest order volume occurs midweek, between 10 AM–2 PM
